   The decred community welcomes security researchers and bug bounty 
   hunters to find security vulnerabilities in its website and projects. 
   All bug reports need to have a clear exploit or POC. All bugs must be 
   reproducible in the latest production release or the master branch of 
   the code. Bugs in old releases or feature branches are not in scope.
