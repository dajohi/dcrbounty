    Decred uses an novel contractor model which allows for proven contributors
    to be remunerated for their good work. This approach has helped forge a
    strong global team of developers, designers, and strategists, as well as a
    robust community. We welcome contributions from anyone who wishes to
    demonstrate their effort and skill in pursuit of the project's mission.
