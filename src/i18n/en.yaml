    Decred uses an novel contractor model which allows for proven contributors
    to be remunerated for their good work. This approach has helped forge a
    strong global team of developers, designers, and strategists, as well as a
    robust community. We welcome contributions from anyone who wishes to
    demonstrate their effort and skill in pursuit of the project's mission.

   The decred community welcomes security researchers and bug bounty 
   hunters to find security vulnerabilities in its website and projects. 
   All bug reports need to have a clear exploit or POC. All bugs must be 
   reproducible in the latest production release or the master branch of 
   the code. Bugs in old releases or feature branches are not in scope.
