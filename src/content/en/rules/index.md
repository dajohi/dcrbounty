**Introduction:**

The decred community welcomes security researchers and bug bounty hunters to find security vulnerabilities in its website and projects. (more text to follow). All bug reports need to have a clear exploit or POC. All bugs must be reproducible in the latest production release or the master branch of the code. Bugs in old releases or feature branches are not in scope.


**Rules:**

We prohibit DDOS or network bandwidth load testing.

Unfortunately we are unable to pay for duplicate reports

Public disclosure of the vulnerability without prior approval will make it ineligible for bounty.

No social engineering.

No spamming.

All Current/Past (For up-to 6 months) decred developers are barred from taking part in this bug bounty program.

Vulnerability reports made before the start of the program will not be eligible for a bounty.

**Reminders:**

Almost all of decred's projects can be run locally and reproduction instruction are available on github. We strongly recommend you to do this.

Always check the "issues" in github of a project to avoid a duplicate report

Use the testnet when possible.

Decred project is not responsible for any loss of DCR due to bug testing. (ie: don't do dumb stuff and lose your DCR)
